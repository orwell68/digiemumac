# digiemu — a Digitakt mk1 and Digitone mk1 emulator

digiemu runs the Elektron Digitakt (mk1)'s and Digitone (mk1)'s own firmware
on a PC. An emulated ColdFire CPU boots the real operating system to its live
user interface, and a clickable front panel plays it: the screen, every key
and encoder with the key LEDs, the sequencer, the +Drive, and live 48 kHz
audio. On the Digitone a second emulated CPU runs the firmware's own FM voice
engine, and the Digitone has a window of its own.

You bring the firmware. digiemu contains none of Elektron's code, and it is
not affiliated with or endorsed by Elektron.


## Quick start (Windows)

1. Download `digiemu-win64-<version>.zip` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/irpina/digiemu/releases) and unzip it
   anywhere you can write to, except a OneDrive folder.
2. Get the firmware from Elektron's website: `Digitakt_OS1.53.syx` for the
   Digitakt, or `Digitone_and_Digitone_Keys_OS1.43.syx` for the Digitone.
3. Run `digiemu.exe`, click **Add firmware** and pick the `.syx`.
4. When it says the firmware is ready, click **Play**.

Step 3 takes about 25 seconds on a desktop (longer on a slow laptop), once
per firmware. digiemu identifies the device and version from the file itself,
prepares an emulated +Drive, and runs the firmware's own first boot, which
installs the factory project and sounds onto it. From then on, **Play** opens
that device's panel straight away, and closing the panel saves the session
so the next Play carries on where you left off. Both devices can be set up
side by side.

The exe is not code-signed, so Windows shows a SmartScreen prompt the first
time, and a PC with Smart App Control turned on blocks it.

## Quick start (macOS, Apple Silicon)

1. Download `digiemu-macos-arm64-<version>.zip` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/irpina/digiemu/releases). Double-click it
   to unpack `digiemu.app`, and drag that into Applications (or leave it
   where it is).
2. Get the firmware from Elektron's website, as above.
3. Open `digiemu.app`. The first time, macOS says it cannot check the app
   for malicious software, because it is signed by its build and not by an
   Apple Developer ID: click **Done**, open **System Settings > Privacy &
   Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to digiemu, then
   open it again. (On macOS 14 and earlier, Control-click the app and choose
   **Open** instead.) macOS asks this once.
4. Click **Add firmware**, pick the `.syx`, and when it says the firmware is
   ready, click **Play**.

An M1 sets a firmware up in well under the desktop's 25 seconds. Audio goes
to the system's default output through AudioToolbox; there is nothing to
install. The app keeps its data in `~/Library/Application Support/digiemu`
(the **Open folder** buttons show it in the Finder), not next to the app, so
it can live in Applications like any other app. An Intel Mac needs a build
of its own from source (below); there is no Intel zip yet.

## Using the panel

- **Keys:** click to press. **Shift-click latches** a key, for combinations
  such as FUNC + a trig; Esc (or *clear latched*) releases them.
- **Encoders:** mouse wheel or drag. Click the letter under a knob to push it.
- **Master Volume** (top left): mouse wheel or drag. A software gain on
  the live output and on PLAY's replay, from silent up to 1.5× (which can
  clip). The real knob is analog, so the firmware never sees it.
- **Audio:** MUTE silences the live output. PLAY replays what has been
  recorded, CLEAR empties the recording, and SAVE WAV writes it to a file.
- **LOAD SAMPLES** (Digitakt only): see below.

Both windows share one plan: Master Volume and LEVEL/DATA at the top
left, the screen, the eight encoders, and one row of keys under them with
the parameter pages and PAGE. The Digitone window has its own
keys (SYN1, SYN2, VOICE, KEYBOARD, T1–T4, MIDI). The Digitone has no
sample engine, so it has no LOAD SAMPLES.

### Loading samples

LOAD SAMPLES picks one or more WAV files and puts them in `/incoming` on the
+Drive, where the Digitakt's sample browser finds them. Any WAV with 8-, 16-,
24- or 32-bit integer samples or 32-bit float samples works, at any sample
rate. Stereo is mixed down to mono, as on the hardware.

The firmware reads the +Drive's file index only when it starts, so loading
restarts it: digiemu saves and closes the session, writes the samples,
rebuilds (about 15 seconds) and opens the panel again. **Changes to the
project that you have not saved on the Digitakt may be lost**, so save first.

A sample keeps its file name, without the extension, up to 64 characters. A
name the Digitakt would confuse with one already there gets `-2`, `-3` and so
on. Files that cannot be loaded are listed and left out before anything
restarts.

### Your firmware folders

Everything lives next to the exe, in `firmware\<name>\`: your `.syx`, the
+Drive image (`plusdrive.img`), the snapshots and the logs. You can move or
copy the whole digiemu folder. On macOS the same folders are in
`~/Library/Application Support/digiemu/firmware/`. **Do not share anything
inside `firmware`:** it is derived from Elektron's firmware.

- **Rebuild** starts the firmware again from its +Drive as it is now. Your
  projects and samples stay; the saved session does not.
- **Reset to factory** deletes the +Drive image and sets the firmware up
  again from scratch.

### Command line

`digiemu-console.exe` does the same without the window, which is what a CI
job testing a custom firmware build wants:

```text
digiemu-console.exe --add FILE.syx [--yes]   set up a firmware (--yes: accept an untested release)
digiemu-console.exe --list                   list what is set up here
digiemu-console.exe --rebuild NAME           start one again from its +Drive
digiemu-console.exe --reset NAME --yes       reset one to factory
digiemu-console.exe --check FILE.syx         check a build before you flash it (exit 0: it passed)
    [--baseline STOCK.syx] [--timing]        compare with this stock build; also time the audio
```

`--home DIR` uses another data folder. Setting up takes about 23 seconds on
the reference desktop, or about 13 seconds on a +Drive that already holds
the factory content.

On macOS the console program is inside the app bundle, so it is
`/Applications/digiemu.app/Contents/MacOS/digiemu-console` (wherever you put
the app) with the same options.

### Checking a custom build before you flash it

In the app, **Check firmware...** takes the build's .syx and compares it
with the stock firmware you have set up here (or another stock .syx you
pick). A check takes a few minutes, runs in the background, and ends with
PASS or FAIL and the reasons. Its report stays in `checks/` next to
`digiemu.exe`.

From source, `emu.fwcheck` does the same from the command line:

```text
python -m emu.fwcheck CUSTOM.syx --baseline STOCK.syx --out check
```

It checks the file as the device receives it (every checksum, the section
table, and a bootstrap version that would make the device rewrite its
bootstrap). It runs the build's own bootstrap from the flash, then boots
the OS from where that leaves it. Then it drives the build with a key
script under a stricter emulator:
- it holds the firmware to the MCF5441x's memory map, instruction set and
  exceptions;
- it times the firmware in core cycles, so the audio render is checked
  against its deadline;
- it compares every screen and sample with the stock build's.

[docs/FIRMWARE-CHECK.md](docs/FIRMWARE-CHECK.md) says what a pass means and
what no emulator run can tell you.

## Status

digiemu is tested with **Digitakt mk1 OS 1.53** (SHA-256
`9bdd44bb6102fb25c143cfab97bc92b7a89c463f795d3112dce89771e29bcc92`) and
**Digitone mk1 OS 1.43** (SHA-256
`c5a54cc05b921f2e4bd814834c5365c2a5aa01d7772a9a2961fac1c3095bf9aa`). Other
releases of the two are offered as untested and run once you confirm. Other
Elektron products are recognised and turned away for now.

**Works:** booting to the live user interface; every key, encoder and key
LED; the sequencer and patterns; the +Drive with projects (and, on the
Digitakt, samples); live 48 kHz audio. On the Digitone the FM voices are
rendered by its second CPU's own code, on a thread of its own. A desktop
runs about 2.5 times faster than the Digitakt needs, which leaves headroom
for live audio; the Digitone also uses most of a second core.
`tools/capbench.py` measures a given PC.

**Not yet:**
- The Digitakt's factory *sample* library lives on the real device's
  storage, not in the firmware, so `/factory` is empty and sounds that use
  it are silent.
- Whether a 44.1 kHz sample plays at the right pitch is not checked yet. A
  48 kHz sample's rendered output has been checked against its source.
- The Digitone runs as a plain Digitone: the Digitone Keys' keyboard, wheels
  and extra keys are not there.
- Some interrupt-controller behaviour is approximated rather than modelled.

[docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) has the details and the list of open work.

## From source

You need Python 3.12 (with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)), a C toolchain
to build the patched Unicorn engine ([docs/UNICORN.md](docs/UNICORN.md)), and
your own `.syx`. Tested on Windows 11, on Linux (WSL2) and on macOS
(Apple Silicon; `xcode-select --install` and `brew install cmake` give the
toolchain).

```sh
uv sync
tools/install-patched-unicorn.sh           # Windows: tools\install-patched-unicorn.ps1
uv run python -m emu.portable              # the app, with its data in portable/
uv run python -m emu.portable --add Digitakt_OS1.53.syx   # or set up without the window
```

The emulator does not run without the patched Unicorn. Of the six patches in
[patches/](patches/README.md), three fix how Unicorn emulates the ColdFire's
flags and its multiply-accumulate unit, and three make it fast enough for
live audio.

To work on the emulator itself (the panel on its own, the boot tools, the
tracing tools), start with [DIGITAKT-MK1.md](DIGITAKT-MK1.md);
[DIGITONE-MK1.md](DIGITONE-MK1.md) covers what the Digitone adds.

### Building the Windows app

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build-windows.ps1 `
    -BuildVenv ..\.venv-build -SitePackagesFrom <site-packages with PyInstaller> `
    -Out ..\build-out
```

The build is offline. It bundles the patched Unicorn from this checkout's
`.venv`, clears the exes' Control Flow Guard flag (Unicorn's `longjmp` fails
under it; the process then has the same protections as `python.exe`), and
runs a self-test of both exes before it writes the zip. The script's header
and [packaging/](packaging/) explain each step.

### Building the macOS app

```sh
tools/build-macos.sh --out ../build-out      # [--build-venv ../.venv-build] [--version x.y.z]
```

It makes `digiemu.app` with PyInstaller from
[packaging/digiemu-mac.spec](packaging/digiemu-mac.spec), bundling the
patched Unicorn from this checkout's `.venv`, then runs the frozen self-test
of both executables in the bundle, audits it with
`packaging/bundle_guard.py --layout macos`, and writes
`digiemu-macos-<arch>-<version>.zip`. The build tools come from
`requirements-build-macos.txt`. The app is ad-hoc signed (what PyInstaller
does on macOS), which is why Gatekeeper asks once; signing with a Developer
ID and notarising would remove that step and are not done here. On an Intel
Mac the same command makes an x86_64 zip. The same script also runs on
Linux, where it makes a plain folder rather than an app, which is how the
spec is exercised without a Mac.

### Releasing

Releases are built by GitHub Actions
([.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)):

1. Bump `APP_VERSION` in `emu/portable.py` in a pull request. Optionally add
   the release notes as `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`. Then merge it.
2. Tag the merge commit and push the tag:
   `git tag vX.Y.Z origin/main && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
3. The workflow checks that the tag matches `APP_VERSION`, then builds the
   patched Unicorn from source and the app on each platform: on a Windows
   runner with `tools/build-windows.ps1` (build tools pinned in
   `requirements-build.txt`), and on an Apple Silicon macOS runner with
   `tools/build-macos.sh` (`requirements-build-macos.txt`). It then
   attaches both zips and one `SHA256SUMS.txt` to a **draft** release for
   the tag.
4. Review the draft and publish it.

A pull request that changes the build runs the same builds without
releasing anything, and keeps the zips as workflow artifacts.

### Tests

`tools/ci/run-tests.sh [PYTHON]` runs every test module on its own. Tests that
need the firmware skip without it, and none of the test data comes from
Elektron. CI runs the tests and a content guard, which rejects firmware,
snapshots, card images and any file over 1 MB, on every pull request.

## Relationship to digikit

digiemu is derived from [m-dwyer/digikit](https://github.com/m-dwyer/digikit)
at upstream commit `a5643ba`. Upstream targets the Digitakt II and Digitone
II, and those paths still work: every mk1 behaviour is selected by the device
file (`devices/digitakt.toml`), and a device file that says nothing keeps
upstream's behaviour. Upstream's README is
[docs/UPSTREAM-README.md](docs/UPSTREAM-README.md), and its research notes are
[docs/FINDINGS.md](docs/FINDINGS.md) and the
[upstream handoffs](docs/history/README.md#upstream-digitakt-ii-and-digitone-ii).

This repository is published as one snapshot rather than with digikit's
history. Not included: Elektron firmware, anything extracted from it
(sections, snapshots, card images), and any tooling for building, signing or
patching firmware images.

## Licence

GPL-2.0-or-later ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). The patches in `patches/` modify QEMU
source vendored inside Unicorn, so they carry its licence.

The licence covers the code here and nothing else. **No Elektron firmware is
included**; it is copyright Elektron. Nothing here grants any right to
Elektron's software, and nothing here is legal advice.

Container-format knowledge derives from `mischa85/elektron-firmware-tool`
(MIT). Architecture and memory-map facts marked *Documented* in
`docs/FINDINGS.md` derive from `lalzart/digitakt-ii-firmware-research-public`
(MIT). MIT is GPL-compatible, so both carry forward under this licence.
