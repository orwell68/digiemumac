"""The portable Windows app: one folder, a launcher, and two hidden workers.

A person who has a Digitakt .syx and a zip should not need a shell, a venv or
a single environment variable. So everything lives NEXT TO THE EXE:

    <APP_ROOT>/logs/launcher.log
    <APP_ROOT>/firmware/<slug>/        one folder per firmware release

and every path the emulator reads (DT2_SYX, DT2_SECTIONS, DT2_SNAPSHOTS,
DT2_PLUSDRIVE, DT2_MAIN_IMG, DT2_DEVICES) is recomputed from that folder on
every start, by plain assignment and as absolute paths. Nothing absolute is
ever stored: the folder can move, change drive letter or be unzipped
somewhere else and still work (snapshots and sidecars hold hashes, not
paths). APP_ROOT is dirname(sys.executable) when frozen; in development it
is --home, else $DIGIEMU_HOME, else <repo>/portable, so running from source
never scatters firmware copies into the working directory.

WHY SEPARATE PROCESSES. The launcher never hosts Unicorn. A native crash in
the patched DLL would otherwise take the window down with it; cancelling
would need cooperative hooks, where a child can simply be terminated (every
stage writes *.tmp and os.replace's, and emu.bootstrap skips stages whose
stamp and outputs verify, so the next run resumes); and the ladder calls
back into Python on every instruction, which would fight a UI thread for
the GIL. So the same exe dispatches hidden modes:

    digiemu.exe                              the Tk launcher
    digiemu.exe --worker first-run <fwdir>   builds; JSON lines on stdout
    digiemu.exe --worker panel <fwdir>       opens the panel for that folder
    digiemu.exe --worker check <checkdir>    checks a build (emu.fwcheck)
                                             before it goes on a device

`sys.executable -m` does not exist in a frozen exe, so only development
spawns `python -m emu.portable`. Workers run with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and opt
out of Windows 11 power throttling: a windowless child on a hybrid CPU is
exactly what EcoQoS parks on an efficiency core.

WHY STDOUT IS RESERVED. The emulator prints freely -- rung lines from inside
an instruction hook, TASK_CREATE lines, symbol notes -- and a piped stdout
in a GUI-subsystem child is cp1252, where one non-Latin path character
raises UnicodeEncodeError inside the hook and kills the ladder. So while a
stage runs, sys.stdout and sys.stderr point at the folder's utf-8 log, and
progress goes out on the ORIGINAL stdout as one ASCII-only JSON object per
line (json's ensure_ascii makes the pipe's encoding irrelevant):

    {"step","kind","done","total","text","data"}  one per emu.bootstrap Event
    {"kind":"result","ok":bool,"error":str|null}   last line, always

WHY A LOCK. Two panels on one firmware both memory-map plusdrive.img and
both flush their whole overlay on exit, last writer wins byte by byte; a
second first run rewrites the snapshots the first is reading. So a worker
holds an exclusive msvcrt lock on <fwdir>/.lock for its whole life, and a
second one on the same folder fails with a clear message. Different
firmware folders run side by side.

WHY THE CARD DECIDES THE SNAPSHOT. A snapshot carries the firmware's RAM,
including its view of the +Drive filesystem. Resuming it over a card that
changed since would pair stale caches with newer content, so the panel
worker asks emu.bootstrap.choose_snapshot, which only returns resume.snap
or gui.snap when the card's recorded stamp still matches; otherwise it
exits 3 and the launcher offers Rebuild (ladder+intro+settle over the card
as it is now; the card itself is kept). After a clean panel exit, which
saved resume.snap, the worker records the card's new stamp. A session that
ends any other way leaves the stamp alone unless the card moved under it
(or dtpanel says it flushed the card but could not save): a halt neither
flushes nor saves, so the last session and the card still agree.

WHY SETTING UP AGAIN IS REFUSED. --add and the launcher's Add on a folder
that is already Ready (or Rebuild needed, or open) do not start a build: a
build reruns the cold boot and throws away the saved session. Rebuild is
its own, explicit action (--rebuild NAME, the Rebuild button), and so is
Reset to factory (--reset NAME --yes, the button), which also deletes the
card and with it every project and sample on it.

WHY THE LAUNCHER RUNS ITS SELF-TEST IN A CHILD. The check that matters runs
guest code in the patched unicorn.dll, and a bad DLL crashes the process
that loads it. So the launcher never loads Unicorn: it runs `--selftest`
as a child at start, reads the JSON report (which names the check that was
running if the child died) and shows what failed, while the list stays
usable.

EXIT CODES (the CLI modes and the workers):
    0  ok (--add of a folder that is already set up: 'already set up';
       --check: the build passed)
    1  a build, the emulator or the panel failed; --check: the build
       failed, or the check could not finish
    2  usage error; from the panel worker: the session could not be saved
    3  not ready: set it up or rebuild it first (--add: Rebuild needed)
    4  untested release (--add) or --reset without --yes
    5  another process holds this firmware folder
    6  recognised product, not supported in this version
    7  panel worker: the snapshot was made by another build of digiemu
       (dtpanel's 4, INCOMPATIBLE) -- rebuild needed, nothing is broken
   64  dtpanel could not parse its arguments (passed through)

emu.release, emu.bootstrap and emu.dtpanel are imported lazily, and looked
up in sys.modules first, so the launcher starts without Unicorn and tests
can stand in for them.
